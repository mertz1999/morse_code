# morse_code

generate morse codes and modulate them into an Audio file.

## TODO

* find a solution for non-supported characters
* use all of a text instead of first line only.
* provide a way to set modulation speed
* optimization with removing unnecessary recalculations when generating audio symbols
* create one shell program for the whole process
